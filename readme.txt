== Description ==

TwitchPress is not affiliated or endorsed by Twitch Interactive, Inc.

The TwitchPress plugin is a new gamers solution for Twitch channels. The TwitchPress goal is to offer WordPress developers a strong start in creating
Twitch related services for either personal use or as a service for other Twitch.tv users. The initial
purpose of the free plugin is to share WP posts of a gaming nature, with Twitch channel feeds. The plugin
can be extended into a broadcasters dashboard.

== Upgrade Notice ==

No special upgrade instructions this time. Just remember to 
backup your site files and database.

== Changelog ==
= 1.2.0 =
* NEW - Setup wizard making installation clearer and more professional.
* NEW - Extensions system so developers can add features quickly.
* NEW - Settings pages now use the WordPress Options API.
* VER - Twitch API Kraken Version 5 now supported.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the TwitchPress plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
