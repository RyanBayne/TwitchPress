# Welcome to the WordPress Channel Solution for Twitch
You have found the best Twitch plugin on WordPress. Continue reading to discover the proof. You are welcome to search "TwitchPress" 
(the projects codename) in your WordPress administration and install the plugin for free.

## About TwitchPress
I really wanted to use TwitchPress as the plugins name but there are certain websites that are cautious about such a name. So the offial
name is "Channel Solution for Twitch" and TwitchPress is the codename. 

The core plugins focuses on providing a professional and stable foundation for a complex Twitch service. Core features include a custom
post type (ID: twitchfeed) for managing a syncronizing service between WordPress blog posts and your Twitch channel feed updates. That 
isn't all the plugin can do though. It also offers an extension system that has no limits. In theory, you can create a public service
that aims to compete with BraneBot or you can just setup a personal system that helps to bring your website and Twitch channel activity 
together.
