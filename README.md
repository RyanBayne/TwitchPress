# Welcome to the WordPress Channel Solution for Twitch
You have found the best Twitch plugin on WordPress. Continue reading to discover the proof. You are welcome to search "TwitchPress" 
(the projects codename) in your WordPress administration and install the plugin for free.

## About TwitchPress
I really wanted to use TwitchPress as the plugins name but there are certain websites that are cautious about such a name. So the offial
name is "Channel Solution for Twitch" and TwitchPress is the codename. 

The core WP plugin focuses on providing a professional and stable foundation for anything from a complex Twitch service to just a couple of time saving tools. Core features include a custom
post type (ID: twitchfeed) for managing a syncronizing service between WordPress blog posts and your Twitch channel feed updates. That 
isn't all the plugin can do though. It also offers an extension system that has no limits. In theory, you can create a public services
that aims to compete with BraneBot or you can just setup a personal system that helps to bring your website and Twitch channel activity 
together.

## Combine WordPress and Twitch Activity
Individuals, stream teams and businesses will find a use for the TwitchPress project. Just consider what you can do by combining your Twitch activity with the power of WordPress. Consider the number of plugins WordPress offers to perform various types of administration and how clever use of the Twitch API allows administrative actions to be applied to Twitch...automatically. I could talk all day about scenarios and what is possible. All you need to do, is contact me, explain your needs and I'll tell you how we're going to achieve them. 

Combine your WordPress and Twitch activity! That is a massive statement when the size of the job is known. What makes it possible, is the TwitchPress extension system. The core plugin offers a good place to start but you'll be glad to read that it can be improved with simple or advanced extensions. 

## Development Standards and Performance
The performance of the TwitchPress plugin has no drawbacks. The design makes perfect use of the WordPress plugin API. Objects are handled effeciently and future development is structured by GitHub.
