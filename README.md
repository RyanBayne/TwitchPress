# TwitchPress WordPress Plugin
Your blog, your channel, your way! Merge the power of WordPress with Twitch to create a unique experience for your
viewers. Superbly developed with the highest standards, bringing a free but professional solution to your website.

## Grow Using the Channel Solution for Twitch 
TwitchPress is a project for everyone. Rising streamers, partnered hosts,
professional gamers and internet based business owners. All dedicated streamers with WordPress sites will find 
value in this Channel Solution for WordPress. The element that allows this to be true is the extension system. It
offers the ability to create custom systems, one extension at a time. If you own a WP site you'll find a way
to grow your Twitch.tv community by using this plugin.

### Main Features
* Custom post type for syncronizing WP posts with Twitch channel feeds.
* Extension system for unlimited upgrades of your Twitch & WordPress marriage. 
* Setup Wizard helps you connect to the Twitch API straight away. 
* Developed for public service providers, create the Streamer Soluton you dreamed, for others.

## Combine WordPress and Twitch Activity
Individuals, stream teams and businesses will find a use for the TwitchPress project. Just consider what you can do by combining your Twitch activity with the power of WordPress. Consider the number of plugins WordPress offers to perform various types of administration and how clever use of the Twitch API allows administrative actions to be applied to Twitch...automatically. I could talk all day about scenarios and what is possible. All you need to do, is contact me, explain your needs and I'll tell you how we're going to achieve them. 

Combine your WordPress and Twitch activity! That is a massive statement when the size of the job is known. What makes it possible, is the TwitchPress extension system. The core plugin offers a good place to start but you'll be glad to read that it can be improved with simple or advanced extensions. 

## Development Standards and Performance
The performance of the TwitchPress plugin has no drawbacks. The design makes perfect use of the WordPress plugin API. Objects are handled effeciently and future development is structured by GitHub. 

# Installation 
The plugin is free to download from WordPress.org and you can locate it from your WP admin by searching

You must complete the Setup Wizard for the plugin to operate fully and make calls to Kraken (the Twitch API). You can access the Setup Wizard at anytime by opening the Help panel.
