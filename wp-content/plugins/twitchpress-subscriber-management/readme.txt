== Installation ==
Requires the Channel Solution for Twitch plugin to be installed first. 

1. Method 1: Move folder inside the .zip file into the "wp-content/plugins/" directory if your website is stored locally. Then upload the new plugin folder using your FTP program.
1. Method 2: Use your hosting control panels file manager to upload the plugin folder (not the .zip, only the folder inside it) to the "wp-content/plugins/" directory.
1. Method 3: In your WordPress admin click on Plugins then click on Add New. You can search for your plugin there and perform the installation easily. This method does not apply to premium plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the TwitchPress plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
