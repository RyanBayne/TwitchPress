Syncronize the data your TwitchPress system needs to run properly.
                       
== Description ==

This is an extension for the TwitchPress plugin. The core TwitchPress plugin
offers channel feed features. Extensions allow us to build a bigger system 

This TwitchPress extension focuses on syncronizing any Twitch.tv data your
WordPress site needs. The plugin will only attempt to syncronize data that is
actually needed by your custom TwitchPress system. Administrators also have
some control over what values are stored.  

Extensions should be integrated with the TwitchPress Sync Extension when
they require data that changes frequently i.e. username and email address
does not change frequently so we would not perform frequent calls to import
that data but subscription related data is different because it can change
monthly. 

Integrating plugins with this extensions will minimize what needs to be
created in the new plugin.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the TwitchPress plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
