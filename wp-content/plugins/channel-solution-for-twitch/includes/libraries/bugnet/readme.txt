======== Handlers ========

A handler is what we use to respond to errors instantly. In most cases
we will use a log file and the database. 

Log file and database allows reports to be generated. Some notices
depend on data logging also, but not all.

======== Notices =========

Notices range from basic to very detailed boxes close to reports. 
There are notices for grabbing an administrators attention urgently, 
notices for educating visitors about a fault or something they are doing
wrong and there are notices for constantly monitoring the website. 

======== Reports ========= 

Reports can be generated for the purpose of professionally monitoring
a WordPress sites health and investigating difficult faults.
