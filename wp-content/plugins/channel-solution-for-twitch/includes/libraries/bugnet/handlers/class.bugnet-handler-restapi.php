/**
 * BugNet for WordPress - REST API Handler
 *
 * This handler allows us to send errors to a selected site that also
 * uses BugNet. The idea is to gather the most critical errors for a network
 * of blogs. 
 * 
 * A key use is monitoring blogs that use the same plugins or themes for specific
 * errors in an effort to debug faults quickly.
