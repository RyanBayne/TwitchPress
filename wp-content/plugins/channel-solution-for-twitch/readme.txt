Launch your own Twitch services using the TwitchPress plugin for WordPress.
                       
== Description ==

TwitchPress is an adaptable solution for the creation of a Twitch service that can do anything Twitch.tv allows. 
Marry your WordPress gaming site with your Twitch channel in everyway possible using the plugins extension system
or create a site that offersr channel management services to the public.

= Core Features =
The initial purpose of the free plugin is to share WP posts on Twitch channel feeds and collect feed updates
from Twitch.tv for publishing as new WordPress posts. All updates to the core will focus on improving this feature
and the plugins extension system. Using the extension system we can make TwitchPress and WP do anything possible
with the Twitch API.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the TwitchPress plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
